#### 1000 App Pledge

The 1000 App Pledge is a challenge I have set out for me to create 1000 apps. I'm doing this to help build my portfolio and improve my development skills. The apps I will develop will range from very simple to very complex and useful.

This the 3rd app I developed under this pledge.

# Open News
It is a beautiful and very useful news app with news from many countries, national and international news channels and websites. Customize the origin of news, category and source to get the news of your interest.

**Minimum SDK Version:** 19

**Clone and import in Android Studio to mess around.**

Screenshots: (Coming Soon...)

Secure Memos for Android: (Coming Soon...)

**The Github community can contribute freely as all the apps under this pledge will be open-source.**
